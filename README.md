Cybersecurity Portfolio Assignment

#Hello, my name is Michael. I started working in cybersecurity while I was in the Army. I instantly knew I enjoyed doing threat hunting and many of the concepts of cybersecurity. After I finished working in the Army I got my first job in cybersecurity and have been doing it ever since.

#Participating in the NCL was my first ever CTF. It has been very fun. It lets me use some of the skills I don't get to use frequently at work or ever at work. I've learned several new skills and am looking forward to improving on them by using some of my elective choices to take a certification that focuses
#on the skills that I'm weak in.

#My highlight from the NCL CTF is completing the recon and scanning category 100% in the individual game. The final challenge was a blast. I was able to complete most of it on my own, but once I got into the hard section I started googling a lot and asking AI questions to solve interesting problems, like how to view a
#photo when you only have access to a CLI. I haven't participated in CTFs before, but I'm going to try and do some in my spare time going forward because it was fun, but also because I learned a lot.
